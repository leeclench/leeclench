## Hi there 👋

I'm Kay Lee Clench, a 38 year old transgirl based in Manchester UK. I started out my career in 2008 and have been working solidly in the devops and cloud platform engineering space since 2016~

- 😄 Pronouns: She/They
- 💬 Professional and Technical interests: Diversity in tech, LGBTQIA+, Chaos engineering, Cloud native technology, Opensource tech, Containerisation, CICD tech, media servers and the likes.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: Enhancing knowledge in the areas of observabiliy, unit testing and GitHub Actions.
- ⚡ Things I enjoy outside of tech: I'm a big fan of art and the world of designer art toys. I am part of a global art collective called Broke Piggy who work with some insanely talented artists from around the world to put on sell out custom art shows at the likes of DesignerCon and Toycon. I also dabble in creating stuff from time to time and am currently working on gaining skills around DJing since getting myself a sweet rig in the Numark Mixstream Pro Go DJ Controller! Looking forward to doing my first live set at a festival during the Summer of 2026. I love to travel and am often helping out as a volunteer at number of events and conventions around the world (typically running AV tech for said large scale events).
